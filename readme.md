# Activity Pub

Activity Pub is a decentralised social network protocol based on Activity Streams format.

In the most basic sense, ActivityPub specifies how different actors can communicate with each other. <br>
This means there are messages, inboxes and outboxes to store them, and activities to receive and send them - respectively. <br>
The vocabulary for these is specified by ActivityStreams. <br>
The ActivityPub standards document has a good overview of what the protocol is and how it is used.<br>

## Project

This project aims to implement a very basic version of the above. It mainly revolves around manipulating class objects.
Thus this is mainly a learning exercise to get more familiar with Java.
